# esp-neopx-denon-remote
This is a little ESP8266 based remote, to control a Denon AVR over WiFi. It uses the MQTT Interface provided by ioBroker.

This project just started and is far from working.

# What's this about
The device in mind should be able to power on my Denon AVR, change the volume and input source.
All by having only a rotary encoder and a neopixel LED ring.
